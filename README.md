# heartdisease
The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end Machine Learning project through a practical problem.

For this project, I chose to predict a health condition: ischemic heart disease.

I trained several ML models and then chose the best performing model and built a web application with microservices. The final step was to deploy the web application using a cloud service, AWS.
