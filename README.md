The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end Machine Learning project through a practical problem. The main steps are: Recognize the problem. Acquire the data. Explore the data and gain insight with visualization. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms. Train several models and choose the best ones. Fine tune the models. Present and interpret the solution. Create a web application and user interface, then deploy, monitor and maintain the system (GÃ©ron, 2019).
