For this project, I chose to predict a health condition: ischemic heart disease.

The main steps are: 
* Recognize the problem. 
* Acquire the data. 
* Explore the data and gain insight with visualization. 
* Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms. 
* Train several models and choose the best ones. 
* Fine tune the models. 
* Present and interpret the solution. 
* Create a web application and user interface, then deploy, monitor and maintain the system (GÃ©ron, 2019).
